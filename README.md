## Keybindings

Here are some suggested keybindings that you can use, but feel free to customize them to your preference.

* Pressing **Mod + F1** enters "workspace mode" where you can create, rename, or delete workspaces using the keys c, r, and d respectively. Pressing Enter or Escape exits this mode.
* Pressing **Mod + Tab** opens a workspace switcher which allows you to switch to another workspace.
* Pressing **Mod + m** allows you to move the current window to another workspace.

The following lines should be placed inside your i3 config file:
```
# manage workspaces
set $mode_workspace workspace:  (c) create, (r) rename, (d) delete 
mode "$mode_workspace" {
	bindsym --release c exec "i3-workspace-manager create", mode "default"	
	bindsym --release r exec "i3-workspace-manager rename", mode "default"
	bindsym --release d exec "i3-workspace-manager delete", mode "default"
    
	# back to normal: Enter or Escape
	bindsym Return mode "default"
	bindsym Escape mode "default"
}
bindsym $mod+F1 mode "$mode_workspace"
bindsym $mod+Tab exec "i3-workspace-manager switch"
bindsym $mod+m exec "i3-workspace-manager move"
```
## Predefined Workspaces

i3-workspace-manager supports the use of predefined workspaces. 
This feature offers these predefined workspaces as options when creating, 
moving, or switching workspaces, in addition to allowing the entry of 
custom workspace names.

To use predefined workspaces, simply add your workspace names to a file named 
`workspaces.lst`. 
This file should be located in the i3-workspace-manager directory. 
The tool will automatically read this file and incorporate these workspaces 
into its functionality.
